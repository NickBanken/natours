# Natours

This is a website that I have made while following a tutorial on Udemy by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.  
I have learnt a lot by following his tutorials, and discovered many CSS/SASS related techniques that I have never seen before.

My goal was to master SASS, while it takes time and practice to master something, I surely do feel like I'm on the right track.
